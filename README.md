## 1.1. Setup
**H.A.M.L. is supported on Linux and macOS, it does not support windows.**

[Interested in what the other shellscripts do?](#112-repository-scripts)

In order to get started clone this repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/EthanG45/CSE412-HAML-Project.git
```

### 1.1.1. Step 1 - Python Dependencies
**H.A.M.L. requires python3 and pip**

**H.A.M.L. requires the following Python dependencies:**
1. PySimpleGUI
2. matplotlib
3. faker
4. psycopg2
5. psycopg2-binary

If you are on Linux, you need to install the following package:
```zsh
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

If you are on macOS, you need to install the following package with homebrew (also get [homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it). You also have to recompile Python with tcl-tk headers:
```zsh
brew install tcl-tk
```

```zsh
latestTclTk='8.6'

latestPython=`pyenv install --list | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//' | grep --regexp '^[0-9]\.[0-9][\.0-9]*$' | (gsort --version-sort 2>/dev/null || sort --version-sort) | tail -n 1`

PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-tcltk-includes='-I/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/include' --with-tcltk-libs='-L/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib -ltcl${latestTclTk} -ltk${latestTclTk}'"

pyenv install ${latestPython}

pyenv global ${latestPython}
```

Reference for this [tcl-tk issue on macOS](https://thad.getterman.org/articles/pysimplegui-and-tkinter-in-pyenv-with-homebrew/).

To download all the dependencies, simply run `scripts/install.py` using the command:
```zsh
python3 scripts/install.py
```

### 1.1.2. Step 2 - PostgreSQL setup
H.A.M.L. relies on your machine having [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). Follow their [setup process](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to get it.

The following exports are expected in your terminal for the duration of using H.A.M.L.

```zsh
export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin:${PATH}" # mac
export PATH="/usr/lib/postgresql/12/bin:${PATH}" # linux
```

```zsh
export PGPORT=8888   # e.g. 8888. It sets the PORT to be this number 8888 which will be used by PostgreSQL
export PGHOST=/tmp    # sets the directory for the socket files
```

If you intend to use H.A.M.L. in more than one terminal session, then add the exports to your .bashrc or .zshrc. If not, then make sure to run the exports each time you use H.A.M.L. in your terminal.

### 1.1.3. Step 3 - Database setup

Run the `./scripts/init_db.sh` command. This will setup the H.A.M.L. database on your machine. It must be run from the root directory.

```zsh
./scripts/init_db.sh
```

### 1.1.4. Step 4 - Run the app
Run the app using the following `gui.py` file:

```zsh
python3 src/gui.py
```

### 1.1.5. Already have the app setup?

Just run `./scripts/start_db.sh` to start the database and `./scripts/stop_db.sh` to stop it when you are done using the app.

```zsh
./scripts/start_db.sh
./scripts/stop_db.sh
```
### 1.1.6. Done with H.A.M.L.?

Just run `./scripts/rm_db.sh` to remove the database and delete this repository.

```zsh
./scripts/rm_db.sh
```

* General things everyone did roughly equally
  * Fixed bugs together (after introducing bugs).
  * Debug issues with the gui/sql, generally the ones they introduced sometimes just getting pulled in regardless to fix them even if they didn’t create them.
  * Documented features and what they generally worked on.
* Arvin Arasteh
  * Implemented the initial database connection to the program’s frontend and implemented most of the SQL queries and functions
  * Helped with the GUI’s different tabs,  and created different graphs for the program

* Aurelio Villalobos
  * Wrote SQL queries to interact with the GUI.
  * Wrote the user manual to explain how to use the program.

  * First to start the gui and implement most of the tabs not all features within each tab though, but still many aspects of them.
  * Edit the SQL functions for the implementation in the GUI
* Ethan Gilchrist
  * Worked on the GUI and a lot of the different tabs. Did most the work on the feeling lucky and insights tab. Helped on all other tabs.
  * Helped with some of the SQL functions. Made and edited the video.
* Jonathan Monk
  * Wrote and helped on a lot of SQL functions.
  * Made edits to the GUI.

* Ramón Deniz
  * Wrote custom GUI windows and components
  * Debugged main issues revolving around the GUI

## 1.10. Developed using PySimpleGUI
  https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/

## 1.11. Known Bugs
1. Insights Graphs don't auto update. This is an issue inherent to the way PySimpleGUI and MatPlotLib are integrated with one another. It's very difficult to redraw the graphs without causing excessive CPU and memory load. We were unable to fix this within the scope of the project.
2. Focus Issues. The macOS version of PySimpleGUI currently has an issue where pop-up windows break the focus from the main window and prevent it from returning. There are some hacky fixes to this, but certain built-in elements can't be prevented from having this issue. One instance is the use of the built-in PySimpleGUI calendar in one of our addition tabs. It prevents focus from returning to the main app. This bug is not present on Linux.
